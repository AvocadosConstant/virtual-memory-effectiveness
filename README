How to run lab 4:
1. make
2. ./lab4 <num-processes> <address-space-size> <page-table-size> <percentage-repetition>
Note: all paramaters are required, none are optional

Num processes: number of processes
Address space size: size of address space of process
Page table size: size of page table for process
Percentage repetition: percentage of repeated references (to manage locality)

3. press enter

Next you can run ./lab5 and the output file created from lab4 will be used.

Thanks!
