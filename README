How to run lab 4:
1. make
2. ./lab4 <num-processes> <min-page-table-size> <max-page-table-size> <address-space-size> -<repetition-flag> <repetition-specification>

Num processes: number of processes.
Minimum page table size: minimum size of page table a process can be given.
Maximum page table size: maximum size of page table a process can be given.
Address space size: size of the address space for a process.
Repetition flag: either -p or -r to specify the proceeding paramater will represent number of phases, or repetition percentage, respectively.
Number of phases: Number of phases the process will go through where the repetition percentage toggles between 10% or 90% (always starts at 10%).
Repetition percentage: percentage of repeated references (to manage locality).

3. press enter

Next you can run ./lab5 and the output file created from lab4 will be used.

Thanks!
