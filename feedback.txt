Feedback from class on lab question sheets:

-capture locality of reference
-how can you specify things from the users?
	-like how will you characterize the locality of reference from a program?
-turn high level ideas into page reference streams that have meaning when you execute page replacement algorithms on them
-how are you going to use your program?
-you might provide more flexibility than you actually use in your study


balance flexibility and scope ***

*chapter 22 of the book will help

-just try enough different things to get meaningful results

hardly anyone seemed to address this in the answers...

how do you express locality?

"we can get % locality, num processes etc from user via command line args" but how exactly is that used/done?
